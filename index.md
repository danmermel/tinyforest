title: Very Minimal Eleventy Template
---

A very minimal Eleventy template based on [this](https://github.com/arpitbatra123/eleventy-blog-mnml), but even more minimal.

- blog posts are added to the `posts` directory and appear in a list on the home page.
- compatible with GitHub Pages.
- includes template `.travis.yml` so that Travis can be used to deploy the blog to GitHub Pages (some additional config required).
- uses minimal [lit CSS](https://github.com/ajusa/lit) template.
