We are a group of local residents working closely with Barnet Council to plant a number of Tiny Forests in the borough. 

A Tiny Forest is a dense and rapidly growing native woodland in a small area the size of a tennis court. 

These Tiny are low cost and low maintenance but can develop a powerful engagement of local people and a positive effect on the environment, including cleaner air and an increase in wildlife.
