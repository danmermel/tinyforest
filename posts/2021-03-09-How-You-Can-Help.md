title: How you can help
---
The first micro forest in Barnet will be planted in Brunswick Park this November. The second will be planted near Falloden way in November 2022.

These are community projects. We need to get local people involved in fundraising, planting and caring for these micro forests. 

We need to raise Â£10,000 to pay for the first two micro forests in Barnet.

We also need to mobilise local organisations (schools, churches, green spaces advocates and others) to help with the soil preparation, the planting and the ongoing maintenance of the micro forests while they are in their infancy (the first 3 years in particular).

If you are a school, do you want to engage your students in a long-term environmental project where they can regularly return to see the fruits of their labour?

If you are a local resident, can you help us fundraise and mobilise your network.
