      <h1>What is a Tiny Forest?</h1>
      <div><p>A Tiny Forest is a dense and rapidly growing native woodland in a small area the size of a tennis court.</p>
<p>These Tiny are low cost and low maintenance but can develop a powerful engagement of local people and a positive effect on the environment, including cleaner air and an increase in wildlife.</p>
<p>This technique was pioneered back in the 1970s by a Japanese botanist called Dr Akira Miyawaki. The process helps build dense, native forests and the approach is designed to encourage tree growth that is faster and denser than usual, which is perfect for urban environments where space is at a premium but that desperately need to tackle pollution and reverse the loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p>Although the technique is more than 50 years old, the Miyawaki method is only now finding favour in Northern Europe. In the UK, organisations like Earthwatch UK and The Conservation Volunteers have been promoting the planting of these forests.</p>
