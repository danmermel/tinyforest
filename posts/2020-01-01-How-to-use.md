To use this project, you first need a copy of the code you can modify yourself:

- Clone this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/glynnbird/eleventy-minimal) and rename the repo to something useful (e.g. `blog`): remember with GitHub Pages the repo name may form part of of your url e.g. https://glynnbird.github.io/eleventy-minimal/.
- Add posts be creating Markdown files in the `posts` folder. Use the existing posts as guides.
- Alter `index.md` to alter the content of the home page.

## Running a web server

To see your site run `npm run serve` and visit http://localhost:8080/. Notice that if you alter and save markdown, CSS or JavaScript files, the rendered web page updates automatically. 

## Building static site

To just build the static files that represent your site run `npm run build`
