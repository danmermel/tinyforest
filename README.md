# eleventy-minimal

A very minimal Eleventy blog template. So minimal that it's hardly even there.

- blog posts are added to the `posts` directory and appear in a list on the home page.
- compatible with GitHub Pages.
- includes template `.travis.yml` so that Travis can be used to deploy the blog to GitHub Pages (some additional config required).

See what it looks like and read more [https://glynnbird.github.io/eleventy-minimal/](https://glynnbird.github.io/eleventy-minimal/).

All of this is a fork of the excellent [Eleventy Minimal Blog]([this](https://github.com/arpitbatra123/eleventy-blog-mnml) which I forked and substantially changed to make even more minimal.
